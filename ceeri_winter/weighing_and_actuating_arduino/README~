Arduno is used to weight the fruit and weight of fruit is used as a trigger for computer to capture an image and start processing. Arudino is also used as final basket solinoid actuator.

The weight of incoming fruits is recorded by the arduino, sent across to the computer via serial when a sweetlime weight value comes in.
The computer sends the final grade of the fruit to the arduino that then actuates the right basket based on readings from a proximity sensor.
